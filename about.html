      <section id="history">
         <h3>A brief history of the CTG</h3>
         <p>Connecticut was once part of the New England Garrison, until breaking away in late 2005.</p>
         <p>It all started when Scott Allen (TK 413) residing here in CT came into contact with the <a href="http://501ecg.com/home/">Empire City Garrison</a> around 1999. In 2001 he founded the <a href="http://www.501neg.com/commlink/">New England Garrison</a>. As the numbers of members grew in CT Scott would regularly seek them out by e-mail or phone to welcome them to the group. He would constantly be found helping others with their armor or another costume, selflessly giving his time and knowledge. Through this, the members in CT started to form strong bonds of friendship which grew into regular social dinners. It was not uncommon to see every active CT member as these dinners grew!</p>
         <p>Connecticut members had always been heavily involved in the New England Garrison volunteer staff--starting with Scott himself as <b>Commanding Officer</b> in both 2001 and 2002. Eventually Charles Corrente (TK 3302) served with Jerry Buote (SL 11) in 2005 as his <b>Executive Officer</b>. Others served in supporting roles such as Treasurer and in Public Relations. It was during this time that we realized that CT was growing into a strong unit that could sustain itself as a Garrison.</p>
         <p>Under the guiding principles of friendship and comradery, the Connecticut Garrison was born. We have continued to foster our commitment to the 501st and to the people in our unit, doing so together.</p>
         <h4>The Founding Members of the Connecticut Squad</h4>

         <p>Thanks to all of the then members from CT who supported and contributed to the new unit!  Thanks to Scott &amp; Jerry for your inspiration, and for being what you thought members of the 501st should be… friends first!</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<article>
   <header>
         <h3>What is the 501st Legion?</h3>
   </header>
   <section class="main-text">
      <p>Since 1997, the costuming organization known as the 501st Legion has spread the magic of the Star Wars genre worldwide through its authentic-looking costumes, and has become the leading horse in fan-based charity events. The 501st, also known as "Vader's Fist," is truly dedicated to brightening the lives of those less-fortunate.</p>
      <h3>What can the 501st do for me?</h3>
      <p>There is nothing quite like a group of Stormtroopers to bring attention to an event. Unlike individual entertainers, the 501st Legion functions as a group creating a true science-fiction/fantasy ambience with a wide range of professional-grade costumes and props. Our internal standards ensure a high level of professionalism in both actions and appearance to ensure your event runs smoothly. Having participated at events throughout the world for nearly a decade, the 501st name alone has been known to boost attendance and media attention. Read some endorsements from our partners here.</p>
      <h3>How do I contact the 501st Legion to attend my event?</h3>
      <p>Click the "Request An Appearance" button at the bottom of this page, or visit the <a href="http://www.501st.com/request.php" target="_blank">Event Request Page</a>.  We look forward to attending!</p>
      <h3>Is the 501st a part of lucasfilm or disney?</h3>
      <p>While recognized by the inclusion of the 501st name in official Star Wars material such as books and video games, the 501st is not affiliated with Lucasfilm or Disney nor do we rely on the company for bookings, event coordination, compensation, or costuming materials. The 501st Legion is a volunteer fan organization.</p>
      <h3>Does the 501st Charge for Appearances?</h3>
      <p>While we do not charge a fee for appearances (public or private), we enthusiastically welcome donations made to your favorite charity in the name of the 501st Legion. If you do not have a charity of choice, we would happily provide you with a list of some of our favorite causes such as Make-a-Wish and the Starlight Starbright Children’s Foundation.</p>
      <h3>Where do you guys get your costumes?</h3>
      <p>Our costumes are the result of careful research, fabrication and a lot of hard work. The majority of our costume components are hand built and assembled in our spare time. Given that the likenesses portrayed by these costumes are the intellectual property of Lucasfilm, it must be stressed that the 501st Legion does not provide or manufacture costumes for purchase.</p>

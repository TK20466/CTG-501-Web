    <p>Wishes on Wheels, Inc. is a non-profit organization made up of passionate and hardworking volunteers committed to a shared goal - to organize a family-friendly truck convoy and event to bring together families, friends and community members to support children with life-threatening medical conditions.  Dozens of local Wish Kids look forward to Wishes On Wheels as an annual tradition that simply can't be missed.  Many of the truck drivers volunteer to have Wish Families ride along with them during the Convoy.  When the Wish Kids arrive, they carefully select the truck they will ride shotgun in during the Convoy or search until they find "their truck" from the previous year.  Upon return to Rentschler Field in East Hartford, there is more fun, food and festivities to help raise money for this important cause.</p>

   <p>This is our 18th Anniversary, last year we raised over $100,000 for Make-A-Wish Connecticut.  In 2014, we had become the first external fundraiser in Connecticut to break the 1 million dollar goal we had set for ourselves!!</p>

   <p>Last year we had over 532 trucks in our Convoy, even with the morning rain shower.  Our event is a rain or shine event.</p>
